Primordialis Unhinged v2 Mod by Andrew Kane (KaneTheMediocre)

If you extract this into your game folder (overwriting "body plans" directory), this will replace many enemies and adds even more.

This mod was compatible with the Primordialis Demo on Nov 27, 2024.  
Due to the rapid and unfinished development of Primordialis, this may not be compatible with later versions of the demo or the complete game. 

Maybe do a backup  of that folder first?  lol I didn't.

It's probably harder than vanilla, but I didn't try to make it harder than it needed to be to make it more interesting.  
On average, the world is more crowded and dangerous, but there's also more experience to be gotten, including freebies from intercritter conflict.
