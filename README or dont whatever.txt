Primordialis Unhinged v2 Mod by Andrew Kane (KaneTheMediocre)

If you extract this into your game folder (overwriting "body plans" directory), this will replace many enemies with weirder things, 
as well as some enemies from dark, 2nd and 3rd areas.

Maybe do a backup  of that folder first?  lol I didn't.

It's probably harder than vanilla, but I didn't try to make it harder than it needed to be to make it more interesting.
