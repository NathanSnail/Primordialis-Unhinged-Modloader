Primordialis Unhinged v2 Mod by Andrew Kane (KaneTheMediocre)

Backup your game folder if you want to be able to revert to unmodded (or differently modded) Primordialis.  

If you extract this into your game folder, this will replace many enemies and add even more.  It will overwrite many creature files in "body plans" directory, the init.lua file in "data/scripts", and add a couple AIs to the "data/scripts/enemies" directory.

This mod was compatible with the Primordialis Demo on Nov 27, 2024.  
Due to the rapid and unfinished development of Primordialis, this may not be compatible with later versions of the demo or the complete game. 

It's probably harder than vanilla, but I didn't try to make it harder than it needed to be to make it more interesting.  
On average, the world is more crowded and dangerous, but there's also more experience to be found.
